Holmes Modular 2HP passive vactrol LPG/VCA circuit

My take on the passive vactrol VCA/LPG. 
You can switch between LPG and VCA. There is a blend pot control that works like clouds to blend between input and output as well as a CV attenuation control for dialing in the CV to get the response you want. Fun little module. Tuned on the breadboard. 
There is no display LEDs, for better over all response of the whole circuit. 
Try playing around with the vactrol types and resisotrs to experiment with different curves, cutoffs and bleed amounts. 
There is no CSV files included with these boards because they are so few components you may as well just hand place them. I made sure to use 0805 component pads but you can use 0603 parts just fine. Assembly should be a breeze.
Enjoy!
