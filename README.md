Holmes Modular 2HP passive vactrol LPG/VCA circuit

My take on the passive vactrol VCA/LPG. I used VTL5C4 but you can experiment with different components. I'd suggest some home made vactrols as well, to test different sounds. You may use pluggable socket pins in the vactrol slot so you can plug different vactrols in and out. You may also swap resistors and capacitors for varried effect.
